#CodeWars
I had to determine how man bumps("n") there is in an array and return the string "car dead" if there are more than 15 ("n") or return the string ("woohoo") if there is less.

##Learned

*I learned how to compare the array to each element in the array. I also learned the split method that counts every element in the array by using a separator.*

#CodeWars
Summation
Write a program that finds the summation of every number between 1 and num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

##Learned

*I learned the proper use of PEMDAS.*

#CodeWars
Reversed Strings
Complete the solution so that it reverses the string value passed into it.

##Learned
 *Learned the methods split reverse and join that can be used to break up words and compounded elements apart to reverse them.*

##CodewarBooleanValue

 Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a "Yes" string for true, or a "No" string for false.

##Learned?

 *I learned more about ternary Operator and how it can simplify functions.*


##SumOfTwo

 Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 integers. No floats or empty arrays will be passed.
 For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.
 [10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453]should return 3453455.
 Hint: Do not modify the original array.

###Learned

 *I learned from doing the sum of two code war how to use the fat arrow function syntax and how to use the sort method on an array.*

##StringorNum

 Convert a Number to a String!
We need a function that can transform a number into a string.
What ways of achieving this do you know?

#learned

I learned how to use the filter method and used the exact comparison operator to get the answer.

##SmallestInArray

Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.
For example:
* Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
* Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.


#Learned

*I learned from this codewar  i learned the sort method and how to use the math operator to find the smallest in the array*

##SentenceSmash

Sentence Smash
Write a method smash that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

Example
var words = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great'];
smash(words); // returns "hello world this is great"

#learned

I learned that one method can do multiple functions.
